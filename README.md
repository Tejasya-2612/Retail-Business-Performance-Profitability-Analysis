Case Study :
A superstore retail business is a large, multi-department store that sells various products, including groceries, electronics, home goods, clothing, and more. These stores are often designed to be a one-stop shop for customers, offering a wide range of products and services under one roof. Superstores are typically larger than traditional retail stores and may have a larger product selection. Superstores are often part of a larger chain and have multiple locations in a region or country.

Recommendations :-
Leverage Discounted Sales :
Since a significant portion of sales comes from discounted products, especially small cart sizes, it may be beneficial to continue offering strategic discounts, particularly for office supplies and technology, which perform well in this regard.

Focus on High-Performing Regions :
The West and East regions, especially California, are your strongest markets. Consider focusing marketing and promotions in these regions to maximize growth potential.

Improve Profitability in Furniture :
Furniture shows negative profitability. It may be wise to assess costs, pricing strategies, or product demand within this category to turn it around.

Optimize Shipping Times :
Standard Class shipments have the longest delivery time (5 days). Streamlining this process or offering incentives for faster shipping options could improve customer satisfaction and boost sales.

Target Order Peaks :
Since orders peak on Mondays and Fridays, you can consider running promotions or marketing campaigns aligned with these days to capitalize on customer buying behavior.

Seasonal and Promotional Planning :
With high fluctuations in Month-over-Month sales, planning for key seasonal promotions or events where sales spike (like March and November) could help smoothen sales volatility.
